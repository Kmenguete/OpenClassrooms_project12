## 1. About the CRM
***
Epic Events is an event management company which is highly reputed for events it 
organizes. The company used to work with an external service provider. Unfortunately,
the Customer Relationship Management(CRM) system used by this external service provider
has been hacked. Consequently, Epic Events was no longer able to work and lost a lot
of clients. Consequently, it was very urgent for them to develop their own CRM. My goal
in this project is then to create a secure CRM system that use Django ORM, Django Rest 
Framework and Postgresql.
